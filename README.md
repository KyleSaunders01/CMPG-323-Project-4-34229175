# CMPG-323-Project-4-34229175

In Project 4 I'm using Robotic Process Automation to do User Acceptance Testing for a program using UIPath.
My Solution in UiPath tests all CRUD operations in the Application.
If the field was succesfully created it has a TRUE value in the given excel spreadsheet
If you want to run and test the program yourself make sure you have UIPath Studio Installed and then just run the solution 
You can run any specific sequence you want to test or you can run the entire main sequence to test everything
